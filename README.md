# Eclipse Geocoding Tool - April 2024 
## Search for Total Solar Eclipse  Information by US Mailing Address

### BACKGROUND: 
The 2024 Total Eclipse that will cross North America on April 8th will be the last chance for many of us to see a total solar eclipse for the next 21 years.  NASA estimates that 150 million people live within 200 miles of totality of this eclipse, 5 times as many poeple as the 2017 eclipse that also crossed the continental US.  

### PURPOSE:
Many useful web tools and resources exist to help plan where and when to go to best see the eclipse.  However, I kept looking for (and couldn't find) a simple tool that allowed you to enter a mailing address and would give you all the planning information you needed about the eclipse for that location - timeline of the eclipse for that location, whether totality could be seen, etc.  So I created the tool that I wanted.
