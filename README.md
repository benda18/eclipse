# Eclipse Geocoding Tool - April 2024 
## Search for Total Solar Eclipse  Information by US Mailing Address

### BACKGROUND: 
The 2024 Total Eclipse that will cross North America on April 8th will be the last chance for many of us to see a total solar eclipse for the next 21 years.  NASA estimates that 150 million people live within 200 miles of totality of this eclipse, 5 times as many poeple as the 2017 eclipse that also crossed the continental US.  

### PURPOSE:
Many useful web tools and resources exist to help plan where and when to go to best see the eclipse.  However, most of these are interactive maps that require you to navigate by hand.  If you're looking for a friend's house a few states over, that could take some time to track down and require multiple web browsers.  I wanted a simple tool that allowed you to enter a mailing address and would give you all the planning information you needed about the eclipse for that location - timeline of the eclipse for that location, whether totality could be seen, etc.  Finding none, I created the tool that I wanted.
